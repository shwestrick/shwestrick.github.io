[Seam carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving) is a technique
for *content-aware resizing*, which changes the size of an image while
attempting to preserve the interesting content of the image. The basic
idea behind the technique is to remove ***low-energy seams***: paths of pixels
that are similar to their surroundings. A removed seam can be either vertical or
horizontal, to reduce either the width or height of an image.

For example, here's a panorama I took a few years ago near Spruce Knob, WV.

The image is super wide, but we can carve it down.
Here's an animation of the process, generated by the
[seam-carver I implemented recently](https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl/pull/123)
as a parallel benchmark for
[`mpl`](https://github.com/mpllang/mpl).

Getting real parallel speedups in this implementation turned out to be an
interesting challenge. For typical images, which are fairly small,
the most obvious approach for parallelizing the algorithm was not able to
extract enough parallelism, because it required too small of a
*[grain size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29)*.
So, I designed a new way of parallelizing the algorithm which works much
better on small images. This post presents some of the details.

## The Seam-carving Algorithm

The idea behind seam-carving is to consider all possible seams in an image,
select the one which least important, and remove it. A ***seam*** is a path of
pixels that cuts across an image, touching one pixel in each row (or column)
along the way, so when we remove a seam, we reduce either the width or height
of the image by 1. We can repeat this process as many times as desired to
reduce the width or height arbitrarily.

We'll base the "importance" of seams on a notion of pixel ***energy***, which
can be defined in
[many different ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient).
For seam-carving, the
[color difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference) gradient
seems to work well, which measures how different a pixel's color is in
comparison to its surroundings. The ***energy of a seam*** is just the
cumulative energies of all pixels touched by the seam. With this setup,
the seam with *minimum energy* should be unimportant and safe to remove from
an image.

To compute *minimum seam energies*, we can use a simple
[dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
algorithm. For simplicity here, let's focus on vertical seams. Let
`M(i,j)` be the minimum energy of
any partial seam that ends at row `i` and column `j`, and let
`E(i,j)` be the energy of the pixel at that position. These minimum seam
energies are related by the following equation:

```
M(i,j) = E(i,j) + min(M(i-1,j-1), M(i-1,j), M(i-1,j+1))
```

A picture might help. For each position, we look at the minimum partial
seams that end above it, pick the smallest, and then add the next pixel.

Once `M` has been fully computed, we can find the minimum overall seam by
working backwards, from bottom to top, by walking upwards along the path of
minimum seam energies starting at the smallest in the bottommost row.

## Finding the minimum seam in parallel

# Row-major order (doesn't work)

The dependencies within the equation for `M` appear to offer a lot of
parallelism. Perhaps the most immediately obvious approach is to compute
`M` in ***row-major*** order,
where first we do all of row 0, and then row 1, etc. With this ordering,
each row can be processed entirely in parallel, because each value `M(i, j)`
only depends on three values `M(i-1, _)` from the previous row.

However, there's a major problem in practice with row-major order:
typical images are only at most a few thousand pixels wide, and each pixel
only requires a small amount of work. That's not enough work (per row)
to parallelize effectively! We'll need a
[granularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granularity_%28parallel_computing%29)
of at least, say, a thousand pixels to amortize the cost of parallelism itself.

This pretty much rules out using row-major order for typical, small images.
Is there a better to compute `M` without reducing the grain size?

# Triangular-blocked strips

To extract more parallelism without reducing the grain size, we need a
better way to partition up the work. This is something that probably
*could* be done "automatically" (e.g. take a look at
[Rezaul Chowdhury](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/c/Chowdhury:Rezaul_Alam.html)'s
work), but here we'll just try to design something ourselves.

What are all of the dependencies for a single value `M(i,j)`? Visually,
the dependencies form a triangle with the pointy-end pointing down:

<img width="60%" src="/assets/seam-carve/depend.svg" />

We can use triangles like these to split up the work in a nice way. First,
image grouping adjacent rows into ***strips***. Within one strip,
cover the top of the strip with a bunch downward-pointing triangles. The
leftover space will look like a bunch of upward-pointing triangles, each
of which has all of its dependencies already satisfied (this is not immediately
obvious but drawing a picture will help). So, we
can process one strip in two parallel rounds, where first we do a bunch of
downward-pointing triangles in parallel, and then we do a bunch of
upward-pointing triangles to fill in the leftover space.

Here's a picture using triangles that are 6 pixels wide at the base. Note that
if we use triangles of even base-width, then these tile naturally with no
overlap.

<img width="60%" src="/assets/seam-carve/strips.svg" />

How wide should each triangle be in practice? Recall that a reasonable target
granularity is about one or two thousand pixels. If we use triangles with a
base-width of 64, then each triangle contains 1056 pixels; a base-width of 90
yields 2070 pixels. So a base-width somewhere between 64 and 90 pixels seems
appropriate.

This is good news: if we use a base-width of e.g. 80, then we can fit
12 triangles horizontally in a 1K-width image, suggesting a maximum possible
speedup of 12x. On a high-resolution 4K image, we could fit 50 such triangles
horizontally. This is a big improvement over the row-major limit of around
2 or 4 grains.

## Implementation and performance

With [`mpl`](https://github.com/mpllang/mpl), I implemented both the row-major
and triangular strategies to compare their performance. The code for the
triangular strategy is available in the `examples/src/seam-carve/` subdirectory
of the [`mpl`](https://github.com/mpllang/mpl) repo. I'll leave the row-major
code as an exercise to the reader. (It's not too bad!)

Here are some performance numbers for
removing 10 seams from an image of size approximately 2600x600. I did a little
bit of tuning, and ended up choosing a row-major granularity of 1000 pixels,
and a triangular base-width granularity of 88 (1980 pixels).

| Strategy   | P = 1 | P = 10 | P = 20 | P = 30 |
| ---------- | ----: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| row-major  | 0.66  | 0.38 | 0.38 | 0.38 |
| triangular | 0.78  | 0.17 | 0.12 | 0.09 |

On 1 processor (P = 1), the row-major strategy is faster by about 15%, but
on more processors quickly hits a maximum speedup of about 2x, seeing no
additional improvement above 10 processors.
In contrast, the triangular strategy continues to get faster as the number
of processors increases, with self-speedups of about 5x on 10 processors,
6.5x on 20, and 9x on 30.

Despite having a mild amount of overhead on 1 processor, we can see that
the triangular strategy provides significant gains. On higher core counts,
it is as much as 4x faster than the row-major strategy.

## Discussion

One might wonder: why are the speedups we got so far away from theoretical
limits? With a base-width of 88, shouldn't we be able to get up to 30x speedup
on an image of width 2600? Well, unfortunately, there are a large number of
barriers to achieving such good speedup in practice: ineffective cache
utilization, memory bandwidth bottlenecks, non-optimal scheduling... and
many more.

In the case of seam carving, there are two major limiting factors.
  1. Seam carving is largely memory-bound, i.e., for each memory access it
  only does a small amount of work before the next access. To get around this
  bottleneck, we might need better cache utilization, and so we would have to
  more carefully lay out the values of `M(i,j)` in memory. (For this
  implementation, I used a simple flat-array layout, where `M(i,j)` lives at
  index `i*width + j`. We could instead try storing these values in a
  hierarchical structure, indexing first by strip, and then by triangle, to
  better improve locality.)
  2. Seam carving has high span, performing a small amount of work in
  between each synchronization. For example in the row-major strategy, we use
  a barrier between each row, and in the triangular strategy, we use two
  barriers per strip. This can cause the scheduler to perform too many thread
  migrations. To mitigate this, one thing we could try is to let triangles
  overlap slightly, to increase the size of each strip. This trades a small
  amount of duplicated work for fewer barrier synchronizations overall, which
  could prove to be hugely beneficial.

let
  val w = ... (* width *)
  val h = ... (* height *)
  fun E (i,j) = ... (* energy *)

  (* Store M as an array, where (i, j) is at index i*w+j.
   * Use setM to update values in the table, and M (which
   * gracefully handles out-of-bounds) for lookup. *)
  val arrayM = alloc (w * h)
  fun setM (i,j) x = Array.update (arrayM, i*w+j, x)
  fun M (i,j) =
    if i < 0 then
      0.0
    else if j < 0 orelse j > w then
      Real.posInf
    else
      Array.sub (arrayM, i*w+j)
