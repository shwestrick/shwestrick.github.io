message: "After a re-read, I probably just mis-parsed \"each row can be processed entirely in parallel\". I read it as \"across the set of all rows, each row can be processed in parallel (but the work within a row is serial)\" (e.g., one row per worker), but of course it could validly mean \"the work *within* each row can be processed in parallel (e.g., one pixel per worker), but whole rows go serially (row 1 must be processed after row 0, etc). \r\n\r\nWhew!\r\n\r\nAnyway, the way you have it now is unambiguous, I think."
