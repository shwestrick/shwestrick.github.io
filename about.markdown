I'm [Sam Westrick](https://cs.nyu.edu/~shw8119/), an assistant professor at
New York University doing research on parallel programming
languages and parallel algorithms. I'm the lead developer of
[`mpl`](https://github.com/mpllang/mpl) ("maple"), an efficient and scalable
parallel functional programming language which helps bring a little joy to the
world of parallel programming. Previously, at Carnegie Mellon University, I was
heavily involved with [15-210](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/),
an introductory course which teaches undergraduates how to *think parallel*.

This blog is mostly a place to share thoughts about my work. You'll find
stuff about parallel algorithm design and implementation, about
parallel programming languages and the development of `mpl`, and maybe
a little about life.
