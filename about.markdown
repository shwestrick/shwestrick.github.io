I'm [Sam Westrick](http://samwestrick.com), and I recently completed by
Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University doing research on parallel programming
languages and parallel algorithms. I'm the lead developer of
[`mpl`](https://github.com/mpllang/mpl) ("maple"), a compiler for Parallel ML,
which helps bring a little joy to the world of parallel programming. At CMU,
I'm also heavily involved with [15-210](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/),
an introductory course which teaches undergraduates how to *think parallel*.

This blog is mostly a place to share thoughts about my work. You'll find
stuff about parallel algorithm design and implementation, about
parallel programming languages and the development of `mpl`, and maybe
a little about life.
